# Python

Python is the Dog of programming -- it loves you uncondtionally.

This repo is an aggregation of Python programs and snippets. I almost always come here before I start writing a new Python script because I have so many useful snippets already written out. And having all of these snippets in one place makes scripting largely *plug-and-play*.
